### Halfway

After 5 weeks at The Iron Yard, I have gained and applied so much knowledge as a Front End Engineer. Walking into the program, I was familiar with the general concepts and the tools used in the industry. I recruited for countless developer positions and constantly saw requirements for experience around JavaScript,  AngularJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, SASS, RESTful and SOAP based services, DOM Structure, and experience testing various OOP languages* ... to name a few*. However, it wasn't until recently that I actually understood what these terms meant and how they interacted with one another. And the most exciting part is the continued expansion within the industry. At times I feel behind the curve and wish I had jumped the fence sooner, but I often remind myself that I have now shifted my career focus to grow alongside the latest and greatest technological practices, tools, and discoveries.

### Learning

One of the most exciting concepts I have learned within the past month has to be JavaScript/jQuery requests to an API server. Until I started using jQuery, I did not understand how this library of JavaScript code could interact and simplify the process. But after comparing the native JavaScript code with the concise jQuery code needed to send an API request, I realized how beneficial jQuery can be for programming.

Using the jQuery AJAX method to request information from various APIs taught me an even higher level understanding of the process as we examined the network to determine status codes for GET, POST, and DELETE requests. In the example below, an ajax call sends a request to the url provided (*the location of the API information*), the data format should be JSON, the method is GET (*to return information*), and the beforeSend would include any authentication necessary to retrieve that information. This summary of the request is followed by **.done()** which can run a function if the request is sucessful.

    $.ajax({
      dataType: 'json',
      url: 'http://requestTo.API.location/',
      method: 'GET',
      beforeSend: authentication
      }).done(function (json) {   ...

### Challenge
Since I started the program, I continue to challenge myself to write dry code from the beginning. This has been a blocker for certain assignments because instead of writing longer code that I know might work, I expect concise code with similar results. This seems to coincidence with my hands-on experience around JavaScript functions, parameters, and syntax because each week, my approach improves and I find myself working towards short interval goals instead of the entire final result. The group API project helped me to focus on this 'one step at a time' approach. And now that the pieces are starting to come together and connect, it has been helpful to review previous material and learn from past challenges.
