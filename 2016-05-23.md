# .mindset{ position: ~~fixed~~ growth; }
**May 22, 2016**

A *fixed mindset* restricts your ability to evolve. You battle internal competition, external competition, and you compete with the **now**. You create false projections about:
* the person are
* the success you have
* the failures thus far

A *growth mindset* reunites your brain with instinct. You free your internal passion and create a blank path to conquer your future. You instill confidence about:
* the person you can become
* the success of your future
* the journey ahead

## the beauty of evolving
As a humans, we naturally want to survive. In fact, our bodies are hard-wired to maintain the necessities: energy and health. We all need air, food, water, sleep, exercise, etc., and we don't even have to exhaust conscious brainpower to register our every need.  We often breath, blink, and heal subconsciously. And I must admit, as much as I have tried in the past, I don't remember the last time I consciously grew taller - the body does all of this for us!

While there are many reasons to recognize and appreciate each of the *fixed* elements in my life, I want to treasure the new and continued *growth* ahead. I love the freedom to focus my efforts on external interactions - physically and socially. I get to make decisions about:
* the food I want to eat,
* the exercises I want to do,
* the hours I want to sleep,
* the city I want to explore,
* the knowledge I want to gain,
* the people I want to meet,
* the friends I want to make,
* etc.

An exciting realization is our natural ability to evolve and adapt. Over time, we learn to use different tools that aid in our existence. We learn to work with other people and we are only continuing to develop new technology to support the future. However, we must embrace the changes and challenges along the way, as they allow the mind to grow.


## turning 25
I used to carry a *fixed mindset*. When I graduated college, I was ready to find a job and support myself, but I was still learning so much about myself. I had a lot to figure out and I still had no idea what I really wanted to do. I understood my interests and abilities (at the time), but I was missing the courage and confidence to take risks. I was looking at medical sales, music studio internships, chemistry jobs, coaching diving part time, and anything I found slightly interesting. I thought I was playing it 'safe' - I thought it would all make sense one day and I would find my purpose.   

Somehow, I became a recruiter in the IT staffing industry. I was ashamed of my first job. I compared myself to fellow classmates, friends from home, and the people around me. I felt like I had taken all the appropriate steps to find a career that would align with my passions, my values, my financial expectations, and the list goes on...

Instead, I started a job with limited passion, found out the company didn't share my values, and quickly realized my thirst for money had diminished. For a while, I kept asking myself: *"What did I do wrong?"* I had support all around me and I had previously excelled through hard work and determination. Nothing was different now. I just wanted to feel proud. I wanted to make it on my own. So, I kept searching for answers after graduation, and two years passed until I found the answer. So what did I do wrong? ... "Nothing."

I was stuck in a *fixed mindset* created by societal pressures, professional pressures, educational pressures, and family pressures. A simple change in my perspective allowed me to understand that college taught me how to problem solve. My first job truly exposed me to the IT industry. And I failed enough to understand what it takes to learn and find the answer.  It might not click the first five times, but determination  always wins.

**Now**, I am ready to continue practicing a *growth mindset* as I enhance my skills as a developer at The Iron Yard. I have already seen what I can accomplish in 1 week, so it is exciting to know that this *growth mindset* happens gradually and allows time to build strength as I continue to expand my perspective within this field.
