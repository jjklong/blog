## Click counting modal

### Getting set up

In order to create a modal and click counter, we will need 3 elements in the HTML:

1. button to reveal modal
2. button to exit modal
3. counter to display

For the first button, we can wrap the content within a div class named *modal_wrap* which will not display on the page until the appropriate button is clicked.  

    <div class="modal_wrap">
      <div class="modal">
        <button class="modal_close">X</button>
        <h3>MODAL TEXT</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

For the second button, we'll do the same:

    <div class="btn1_wrap">
      <button type="button" class="btn1">click me!</button>
    </div>

For the counter, we'll make an empty div to be filled with the current count:

    <div class="counter">
    </div>

### jQuery
We're going to need one variable to determine the counter and two functions to add and remove the modal display. The *showing* class changes the display from *none* to *block* in order to reveal the modal.  

    * var counter = 0;
    * function () - $('.modal_wrap').addClass('showing');
    * function () - $('.modal_wrap').removeClass('showing');

Since the counter variable is starting at 0, it can be nested within the first 'click' function to track the current number.

    counter++;

To display the current number, we can select the counter div and input html:

    $('.counter').html(counter);

The functions to add and remove class should select the correct div and run the function on('click') while entering the text content:

    $('.btn1').on('click', function () {
      $(this).text('shown when clicked');

Now you should style your modal and click counter!
