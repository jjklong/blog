# Pair Programming

This past weekend, I traveled up to Indiana to watch the 100th race at the Indy 500. After researching pair programming, I found some interesting similarities between racing cars and programming software.

Now, I am not much of a race car fan, but it is an exciting sport to watch when you're surrounded by 350,000 people inside a 2.5 mile track. And it's even more interesting when you think about the practice and precision needed to win such a dangerous event.

This year, a rookie won the race with a unique story. Within the final laps, the leading drivers were communicating with their pit crew to determine the status of the car and if they should fuel up or push through the finish. The winning rookie and his crew decided to fight through on fumes and he ended up coasting to the finish line on empty. It was exciting to watch, but it wasn't until I heard the post-race commentary that I truly understood what happened behind the scenes.

During the race, the drivers are constantly checking in with their pit crew, and the pit crews are constantly checking in with their driver. Together, they determine the car status, the race strategy, and assess any potential risks ahead. For 500 miles, they are making critical decisions as a team with one person driving and the other navigating. This brings me to the comparison with **pair programming**.

## 2 > 1
In pair programming, two developers are in constant communication as they work together sharing one computer. One person is usually *driving* while the other helps *navigate*. In the driver seat, the individual types out the code and focuses on the accuracy of each line. While navigating, the individual helps review the driver's work and keeps the team on the right path. This gives both developers a specific focus which can create better results.
With teamwork and constant communication, both the Indy 500 and Pair Programming portray efficient methods when working together to achieve the same result. This reduces room for error since two developers are reviewing each line of code. It also allows for collaboration and ideas to expand upon each other. Two brains > one brain.
